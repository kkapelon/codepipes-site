				<h3>The Rise (And Fall?) of Application Stores  (2011)</h3>
					<p>
				This article came as a reaction of the huge success of the Apple appstore where developers give 30% of their earnings to Apple.

			<h3>Regarding High Level Computing (2004)</h3>
					<p>
				This article documents my frustrution with lack of standards and common sense in our computing environments. Strangely enough, some of the features I requested in 2004 <a href="img/prediction.png">were implemented in 2011</a> by Appe.
